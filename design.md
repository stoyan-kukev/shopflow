## 5. Database Design

### DrizzleORM Schema:

```typescript
import { pgTable, text, timestamp, integer, decimal, serial, uniqueIndex } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

// Required tables for Lucia Auth
const userTable = pgTable("user", {
    id: text("id").primaryKey(),
    email: text("email").notNull(),
    passwordHash: text("password_hash").notNull(),
});

const sessionTable = pgTable("session", {
    id: text("id").primaryKey(),
    userId: text("user_id")
        .notNull()
        .references(() => userTable.id),
    expiresAt: timestamp("expires_at", {
        withTimezone: true,
        mode: "date"
    }).notNull()
});

// Capabilities table
const capabilityTable = pgTable("capability", {
    id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
    name: text("name").notNull().unique()
});

// User-Capability junction table
const userCapabilityTable = pgTable("user_capability", {
    userId: text("user_id").notNull().references(() => userTable.id),
    capabilityId: integer("capability_id").notNull().references(() => capabilityTable.id)
});

// Additional tables for the inventory management system
const productTable = pgTable("product", {
    id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
    name: text("name").notNull(),
    description: text("description"),
    sku: text("sku").notNull(),
    price: decimal("price", { precision: 10, scale: 2 }).notNull(),
    quantity: integer("quantity").notNull().default(0),
    reorderPoint: integer("reorder_point").notNull().default(10),
    categoryId: integer("category_id").references(() => categoryTable.id)
}, (table) => {
    return {
        skuIdx: uniqueIndex("sku_idx").on(table.sku)
    }
});

const categoryTable = pgTable("category", {
    id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
    name: text("name").notNull()
});

const orderTable = pgTable("order", {
    id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
    userId: text("user_id").notNull().references(() => userTable.id),
    orderDate: timestamp("order_date").notNull().defaultNow(),
    status: text("status").notNull().default("pending"),
    totalAmount: decimal("total_amount", { precision: 10, scale: 2 }).notNull()
});

const orderItemTable = pgTable("order_item", {
    id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
    orderId: integer("order_id").notNull().references(() => orderTable.id),
    productId: integer("product_id").notNull().references(() => productTable.id),
    quantity: integer("quantity").notNull(),
    unitPrice: decimal("unit_price", { precision: 10, scale: 2 }).notNull()
});

const storeTable = pgTable("store", {
    id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
    name: text("name").notNull(),
    address: text("address")
});

const storeInventoryTable = pgTable("store_inventory", {
    storeId: integer("store_id").notNull().references(() => storeTable.id),
    productId: integer("product_id").notNull().references(() => productTable.id),
    quantity: integer("quantity").notNull().default(0)
});
```

This schema defines the following main tables:

1. `user`: Stores user information and is required by Lucia Auth.
2. `session`: Manages user sessions and is required by Lucia Auth.
3. `capability`: Stores available capabilities in the system.
4. `user_capability`: Associates users with their capabilities.
5. `product`: Stores product information including name, SKU, price, and quantity.
6. `category`: Allows products to be organized into categories.
7. `order`: Represents customer orders with information about the user, date, and total amount.
8. `order_item`: Represents individual items within an order, linking to products and quantities.
9. `store`: Represents individual store locations.
10. `store_inventory`: Tracks inventory levels for each product at each store.

This schema covers the core functionality of the inventory management system, including user authentication, capability-based authorization, product management, categorization, order processing, and multi-store inventory tracking. It provides a solid foundation for building the required features outlined in the project scope.

## 6. API Design

### Main API Endpoints:

1. Authentication:
   - POST /auth/login
   - POST /auth/logout
   - POST /auth/refresh-token

2. Users:
   - GET /users
   - POST /users
   - GET /users/:id
   - PUT /users/:id
   - DELETE /users/:id
   - POST /users/:id/capabilities
   - DELETE /users/:id/capabilities/:capabilityId

3. Products:
   - GET /products
   - POST /products
   - GET /products/:id
   - PUT /products/:id
   - DELETE /products/:id

4. Orders:
   - GET /orders
   - POST /orders
   - GET /orders/:id
   - PUT /orders/:id
   - DELETE /orders/:id

5. Inventory:
   - GET /inventory
   - PUT /inventory/:productId
   - POST /inventory/transfer

6. Reports:
   - GET /reports/sales
   - GET /reports/inventory

### Request/Response Formats:
All API endpoints will use JSON for both request bodies and responses. Each response will include a status code, a message, and the requested data (if applicable).

Example response:
```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Success",
  "data": {
    // Returned data object
  }
}
```

### ElysiaJS Implementation:
ElysiaJS will be used to create the API routes, handle request parsing, and manage response formatting. It will also be responsible for integrating middleware for authentication, error handling, and request validation.

## 7. User Interface Design

### UI/UX Approach:
The user interface will follow a clean, modern design with a focus on usability and efficiency. It will be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices.

### Key Pages/Components:
1. Dashboard
2. Inventory Management
3. Order Processing
4. Reporting
5. User Management
6. Capability Management

### Wireframes:
(Include wireframe images for key pages/components)

### Svelte Implementation:
Svelte will be used to create reusable components and manage the application state. It will handle client-side routing, form validation, and real-time updates using its reactive programming model.

## 8. Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Flow:
1. User submits login credentials
2. Server validates credentials using Lucia Auth
3. If valid, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client
4. Client stores the token and includes it in the header of subsequent requests
5. Server validates the token for each protected request

### Authorization Process:
- Capability-based access control will be implemented
- Each user will be assigned one or more capabilities (e.g., "manage_inventory", "process_orders", "generate_reports")
- API endpoints will check the user's capabilities to determine access permissions

### Security Measures:
- Use of HTTPS for all communications
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Implementation of refresh tokens for extended sessions
- Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## 9. Data Flow

### Data Flow Diagram:
(Include a diagram showing how data flows through the system)

### Real-Time Updates:
- WebSocket connections will be used for real-time inventory updates
- Svelte's reactive programming model will ensure the UI reflects these updates immediately

## 10. Integration and External Services

### Third-Party Integrations:
1. Payment Gateway (e.g., Stripe)
2. Shipping API (e.g., ShipStation)
3. Point of Sale (POS) Systems

### Implementation:
- Create adapter modules for each third-party service
- Use webhooks for real-time updates where available
- Implement retry mechanisms and error handling for external API calls

## 11. Performance Considerations

### Expected Load:
- Up to 1000 concurrent users
- Peak times during business hours and holiday seasons

### Scalability Requirements:
- Ability to handle a 200% increase in load without significant performance degradation

### Optimization Strategies:
- Implement caching using Redis for frequently accessed data

## 19. Authentication and Authorization Implementation

### ElysiaJS and DrizzleORM with Lucia Auth and Capability-Based Authorization

```typescript
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3';
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { sqliteTable, text, integer } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core';
import { lucia } from "lucia";
import { elysia } from "lucia/middleware";

// Database setup
const sqlite = new Database('auth.db');
const db = drizzle(sqlite);

// Schema
const users = sqliteTable('user', {
  id: text('id').primaryKey(),
  username: text('username').notNull(),
  passwordHash: text('password_hash').notNull(),
});

const sessions = sqliteTable('session', {
  id: text('id').primaryKey(),
  userId: text('user_id')
    .notNull()
    .references(() => users.id),
  expiresAt: integer('expires_at').notNull()
});

const capabilities = sqliteTable('capabilities', {
  id: integer('id').primaryKey(),
  name: text('name').notNull(),
});

const userCapabilities = sqliteTable('user_capabilities', {
  userId: text('user_id').notNull().references(() => users.id),
  capabilityId: integer('capability_id').notNull().references(() => capabilities.id),
});

// Lucia setup
const auth = lucia({
  adapter: {
    // Implement Lucia adapter for DrizzleORM
  },
  env: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? "DEV" : "PROD",
  middleware: elysia(),
});

type Auth = typeof auth;

// Helper functions
const hasCapability = (capability: string) => async (c: any) => {
  const session = await auth.validateSession(c.request.headers.get("Authorization")?.split(" ")[1] ?? "");
  if (!session.user) {
    c.set.status = 401;
    return false;
  }
  const userCaps = await db.select()
    .from(userCapabilities)
    .innerJoin(capabilities, sql`${capabilities.id} = ${userCapabilities.capabilityId}`)
    .where(sql`${userCapabilities.userId} = ${session.user.userId}`);

  return userCaps.some(cap => cap.capabilities.name === capability);
};

// API
const app = new Elysia()
  .use(auth.elysia())
  .post('/register', async ({ body }) => {
    const { username, password } = body;
    // Use Lucia to create user
    const user = await auth.createUser({
      key: {
        providerId: "username",
        providerUserId: username,
        password
      },
      attributes: {
        username
      }
    });
    return 'User registered';
  }, {
    body: t.Object({
      username: t.String(),
      password: t.String(),
    })
  })
  .post('/login', async ({ body, set }) => {
    const { username, password } = body;
    // Use Lucia to validate credentials and create session
    const key = await auth.useKey("username", username, password);
    const session = await auth.createSession({
      userId: key.userId,
      attributes: {}
    });
    set.headers['Set-Cookie'] = auth.createSessionCookie(session.id).serialize();
    return 'Logged in';
  }, {
    body: t.Object({
      username: t.String(),
      password: t.String(),
    })
  })
  .get('/protected', async (c) => {
    const session = await auth.validateSession(c.request.headers.get("Authorization")?.split(" ")[1] ?? "");
    if (!session.user) {
      c.set.status = 401;
      return 'Unauthorized';
    }
    return `Hello, ${session.user.username}!`;
  })
  .get('/admin',
    async ({ set }) => {
      set.status = 200;
      return 'Admin area';
    }, {
      beforeHandle: [hasCapability('ADMIN')]
    }
  )
  .listen(3000);

console.log(`Server is running on ${app.server?.hostname}:${app.server?.port}`);
```

This code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation of capability-based authentication and authorization using ElysiaJS and DrizzleORM with SQLite. It includes:

1. Database setup with user, capability, and user-capability tables.
2. Registration and login endpoints.
3. A middleware for token-based authentication.
4. A capability check middleware.
5. Protected routes that require authentication and specific capabilities.

Note: This is a simplified example. In a production environment, you should use proper password hashing, JWT for tokens, and implement more robust error handling and security measures.
